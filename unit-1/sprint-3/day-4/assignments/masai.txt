Firstly, I thank Masai to provide a great opportunity to explore my carrier in the Software field. 
The journey was not started on 14 Nov but started a few months back, one of my friend's brothers told bhaiya why you do not pursue a carrier in the I.T. field and you also completed your B. Tech in Information Technology stream. I told him I want to do a job in the I.T. field but due to my past health issue I am thinking about that carrier and now I am preparing for Govt. Exam and also I told him I was completed my B. Tech in 2019 and I have no experience, without experience who will provide a job. He said don't worry bhaiya there is a coding school where you have the opportunity to learn language and DSA and for more information, you search online.

This is the story behind the joining of Masai School.
